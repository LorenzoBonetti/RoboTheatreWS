#Parameters for global_planner, NB: if you want to use it set the parameter base_global_planner: "global_planner/GlobalPlanner" in the file move_base_general_params. Reference at: http://wiki.ros.org/global_planner
GlobalPlanner:

#Specifies whether or not to allow navfn to create plans that traverse unknown space. Decided to not allow to go to unknown space
 allow_unknown: false 

#A tolerance on the goal point for the planner. Global Planner will attempt to create a plan that is as close to the specified goal as possible but no further than default_tolerance away.
 default_tolerance: 0.0 #default value TBD resize this

#Specifies whether or not to visualize the potential area computed by navfn via a PointCloud2.
 visualize_potential: false

#If true, use dijkstra's algorithm. Otherwise, A*. 
 use_dijkstra: true

#If true, use the quadratic approximation of the potential. Otherwise, use a simpler calculation. 
 use_quadratic: true

#If true, create a path that follows the grid boundaries. Otherwise, use a gradient descent method. 
 use_grid_path: false
   
#If for some reason, you want global_planner to exactly mirror the behavior of navfn, set this to true (and use the defaults for the other boolean parameters) 
 old_navfn_behavior: false
    
#Lethal Cost (dynamic reconfigure) 
 lethal_cost: 253

#cost= NEUTRAL_COST +COST_FACTOR*costmap_value= MAX 253, costmap_value range(0,252) so cost_factor=0.8

#Neutral Cost (dynamic reconfigure) 
 neutral_cost: 50

#Factor to multiply each cost from costmap by (dynamic reconfigure) 
 cost_factor: 0.8

#Publish Potential Costmap (dynamic reconfigure) 
 publish_potential: true

#How to set the orientation of each point (None=0, Forward=1, Interpolate=2, ForwardThenInterpolate=3, Backward=4, Leftward=5, Rightward=6) (dynamic reconfigure) 
 orientation_mode: 0

#What window to use to determine the orientation based on the position derivative specified by the orientation mode (dynamic reconfigure) 
 orientation_window_size: 1
