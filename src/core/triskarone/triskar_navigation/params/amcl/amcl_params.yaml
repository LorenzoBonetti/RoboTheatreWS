#Laser model parameters
#Note that whichever mixture weights are in use should sum to 1. The beam model uses all 4: z_hit, z_short, z_max, and z_rand. The likelihood_field model uses only 2: z_hit and z_rand.

#Odometry model parameters
#If ~odom_model_type is "omni" then we use a custom model for an omni-directional base, which uses odom_alpha1 through odom_alpha5. The meaning of the first four parameters is similar to that for the "diff" model. The fifth parameter capture the tendency of the robot to translate (without rotating) perpendicular to the observed direction of travel.

#Robot is omnidirectional, omni_corrected is used since it has some bugs corrected 
odom_model_type: "omni_corrected"
#Specifies the expected noise in odometry's rotation estimate from the rotational component of the robot's motion. 
odom_alpha1: 1
#Specifies the expected noise in odometry's rotation estimate from translational component of the robot's motion. 
odom_alpha2: 1
#Specifies the expected noise in odometry's translation estimate from the translational component of the robot's motion. 
odom_alpha3: 1
#Specifies the expected noise in odometry's translation estimate from the rotational component of the robot's motion. 
odom_alpha4: 1
#Translation-related noise parameter.
odom_alpha5: 1
#Which frame to use for odometry. 
odom_frame_id: "odom"
#Which frame to use for the robot base 
base_frame_id: "base_link"
#The name of the coordinate frame published by the localization system 
global_frame_id: "map"
#Set this to false to prevent amcl from publishing the transform between the global frame and the odometry frame.
